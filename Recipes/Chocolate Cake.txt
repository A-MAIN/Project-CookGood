Grease and line three #20cm cake tins{3} with #parchment paper{}.
In a #large bowl{}, sift together the @flour{1.5%cups}, @cocoa powder{1%cup}, @salt{1%teaspoon}, @baking soda{1.5%teaspoon}, and @baking powder{0.5%teaspoon}. Set aside.
In a #large glass measuring cup{}, combine the @stout{1.5%cups}, @vanilla{1%tablespoon}, and @espresso powder{1%tablespoon}. Set aside.
In a #large mixing bowl{}, cream together the @butter{1%cup} and @sugar{1.5%cup} until it is light and fluffy, about ~{5%minutes}, scraping down the sides occasionally to ensure all the ingredients are being evenly creamed together.
Beat in the @eggs{3}, one at a time, ensuring each @egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.
Add the @mayonnaise{1.5%cup} and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
Preheat oven to 160˚C.
Alternate between adding the prepared dry and wet ingredients to the batter. Starting with about ⅓ of the dry ingredients, beat until incorporated. Then add ⅓ of the liquid ingredients, mixing until the batter comes together. Continue until all the wet and dry ingredients have been incorporated.
Using a #rubber scraper{}, fold the @dark chocolate chunks{120%grams} into the batter.
Distribute the batter evenly between the 3 prepared #cake tins{}.
Bake for about ~{35%minutes}, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
Place the cakes on a #cooling rack{} and leave to cool for about ~{15%minutes}, until the outside of the pan is cool enough to touch.
Once the cakes have cooled, loosen the edges using a #butter knife{}. Then place a #large plate{} over the tin and invert to release the cake from the #pan. Remove the #parchment paper{} from the bottom of the cake and slide the cake back onto the cooling rack to cool completely. Repeat for the remaining two layers.
While your cakes are cooling, prepare the buttercream.
In a #large bowl{}, beat together the @butter{350%grams} and @vanilla{1%tablespoon}.
Gradually add in the @cocoa powder{60%grams}, @powdered sugar{5%ucps}, and @milk{5%tablespoons}, continuously beating until all the ingredients have been incorporated and the frosting is light and fluffy.
Frost and decorate to your liking.
Slice and serve.
